        <p>If you can establish a daily routine then you are far more likely to practice, even when you don't necessarily feel like it. This will make your progress immeasurably greater than someone who only practices when they really want to. By having a disciplined approach, you will simply spend more time behind the kit.</p>

      <div class="paragraph">
        <p>I like to think of drumming as three separate areas, and then I work on each of them individually. In reality, each of these areas are vastly complex and intertwined with one another, but it helps to think of it in those terms. Firstly, I practice rudiments, the foundational drumming techniques and bread and butter of the instrument. Then I move onto styles; learning specific grooves and patterns that fit in with whatever genre I am interested in that day. Finally I spend some time on independence excersises, training my limbs and brain to be more relaxed and competent when playing tricky grooves. </p>

      </div>
      <div class="paragraph">
        <p>It doesn't matter how much you practice, at some point you've just gotta get out there and play with other musicians. Otherwise, what's it all for? This is the hardest but also most rewarding aspect of learning any instrument; performance. Hopefully, you will make friends for life and form a kickass band!</p>
